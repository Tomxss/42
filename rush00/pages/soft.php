	<h1>Soft cheese</h1>
	<p style="margin: 35px; font-size: 25px;">Soft cheeses offer a truly unique taste to the cheese connoisseur. These cheeses typically aren't matured, and feature a milder taste and a richer, creamier texture than their firmer counterparts. Top soft cheeses can be spread onto toast, served with a fruit plate, or layered atop crackers â€“ but unlike hard cheese, these soft varieties aren't ideal for cooking. Tasty soft cheeses are made in countries all over the world including France, Italy, and America. This type of cheese includes Camembert and Brie, and they have a delicate taste. They are produced by leaving curdled milk to drain in moulds for a few hours before salting. </p>
	<p style="margin: 35px; font-size: 25px;">Very often, soft cheeses are served with crusty bread and fresh grapes at the end of a meal. However, they are also served at wine and cheese tastings, or added to sandwiches, soups and cooked dishes.</p>
