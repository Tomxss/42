	<p style="margin: 35px; font-size: 25px;">There is a growing divide between fruit and vegetables when it comes to the Chinese import and export markets. DCF Produce Co., Ltd. is a specialized trade company with years of experience in import and export. 
	DCF began exporting Chinese vegetables to Southeast Asian countries in 1988. </p>
	<p style="margin: 35px; font-size: 25px;">"There are several reasons for this shift in the export of fresh produce from vegetables to fruit: first, fruit is easier to store than vegetables. For example, many leafy vegetables are difficult to keep fresh even during transport. We can only export them to nearby countries, while fruit like oranges can be exported anywhere on the globe because we can extend the period that they stay fresh.</p>
